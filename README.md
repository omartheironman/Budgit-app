# Budgit-app


I was fed up with my out of control spending, and decided to do something about. One day as I inserted my calories into MyFitnesspal, 
I decided if design an app that would allow me to track down how much I spent and allocate a certain budget would be probably help me. 

Not just that I wanted to also leverage other ideas to show me deals to spent the funds I was able to save.
